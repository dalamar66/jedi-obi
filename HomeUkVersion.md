The JEDI-OBI package (Java Enhanced Directory Interface / Object Intelligence) is designed to facilitate the use of the standard library JNDI(javax Naming Directory Interface) which allows access to the LDAP/Active Directory. JEDI includes several complementary functions,  including a pool of connections, attributes list management, search by approximation (with a choice of method). OBI (Object Intelligence) makes it possible to work with business objects.

This library is very user-friendly and is suitable for beginners and experienced users.

A javadoc, project sources and examples of JUnit tests are available:

  * Jedi allows all operations on all object types.
  * Obi implements the services of persons, users, computers, and the Organizational-unit group (... for the moment).
  * Dsml allows all object types to be imported and exported and compared.

Version 2.3.0 is available!
